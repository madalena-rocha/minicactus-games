# minicactus-games
Modification of the "Doctor Care" project developed at Rocketseat's Next Level Week - NLW Return to create the Minicactus Games website

The project has four main sections, namely: "Game List", "News", "About" and "Contact". The main changes I made in the original project were the redefinition of the home section to present the list of games and the creation of the news section, in addition to adapting the content of the sections and customizing it according to the needs of the company.
